    <p> <h1> News Search System Study </h1></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this study related on News Search Systems.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2><b>Important Notes</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Please do not use the "Back" or "Forward" functionality of your Web browser to navigate yourself through the process.</strong></li>
        <li> At the end of the experiment, you will be redirected back to MTurk to submit the HIT.</li>
        <li>In order to conduct this experiment you need to use Safari, Firefox or Chrome.
            <strong>If you use any other browser, your HIT may not be accepted.</strong></li>
        <li>Your screen resolution should be at least <strong>1024x768</strong> or above, otherwise your HIT will not be accepted.</li>
        <li>Please read instructions throughout this experiment carefully. You will not be able to return to previous pages or resubmit your answers.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For this study, imagine that you are a newspaper reporter, where you will need to write a story on
            four topics. In order to accomplish this you will need to search for related background information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search Systems</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The search systems that you will use connect to a database of about 1 million news articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Xinhua</em> news agencies. The articles
            within the database were published in 1998 to 2000. The search system you will be using looks similar to a web search engine, though there might be some slight differences to the search interface.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For each search task, you'll be given a short description of a topic and
            what information would be relevant to this topic. </li>
        <li> This can be viewed by the <b>Show Task</b> button at the top right-hand corner of the screen.</li>
        <li>You need to pose queries and examine results, just like you would in a web search engine.</li>
        <li> When viewing documents, you will be able to select the <b>Mark as Relevant</b> button when you find a document relevant to
            the topic. </li>
        <li>
        There are <b>over 100 relevant documents</b> in the database for each topic.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2><b>Goal</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Your goal is to find and SAVE {{ target }} useful documents for each tasks.</b>
        </li>

        <li>From previous studies, we have a GOLD standard of useful documents.</li>
        <li> Pay close attention to the task description - as there are two kinds of search task.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(1)</strong> Find documents that match the criteria specified i.e. <strong>RELEVANT</strong></li>
            <li><strong>(2)</strong> Find documents that match the criteria specified but report different aspects, i.e. <strong>RELEVANT</strong> and <strong>DIFFERENT</strong>.</li>

        <li> For example, let's say the topic is on "People Smuggling" and the criteria states that a <strong>RELEVANT</strong> document must identify the country where people were smuggled from, how they were smuggled and how many. </li>
            <li> For search tasks where we ask for <strong>RELEVANT</strong> documents,
                if you find 4 documents where people from <i>Canada</i> have been smuggled into the US, these are all considered useful.</li>
            <li> However, for search task were we ask for <strong>RELEVANT</strong> and <strong>DIFFERENT</strong> documents, if you find 4 documents where people from <i>Canada</i> have been smuggled into the US.
            Only 1 document is considered useful. Therefore, other documents need to be found, i.e. involving smuggling from <i>Mexico</i>, <i>Chile</i>, etc. to count as being useful, (<strong>RELEVANT</strong> and <strong>DIFFERENT</strong>).</li>
            <li> Note: You can review your saved documents and the task description while searching.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Success and Payment</b></h2>
        <ul>

        <li> You will be paid <strong>ONLY IF</strong> you successfully complete all four tasks.</li>
            <li> To be successful you must have <b>saved at least {{ target }} useful documents</b> per search task, AND</li>
            <li> <b>No more than {{ target }} documents that are not useful</b> per search task, i.e. accuracy greater than 50 percent.</li>
            <li> That is, if you save more <strong>NOT RELEVANT</strong> documents than <strong>RELEVANT</strong> documents, the task will be deemed unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> From previous studies, most participants identified 5-10 <strong>RELEVANT</strong> documents in around 7-8 minutes with accuracy greater than 50 percent.</li>
        <li><strong>Thus the experiment will take approximately 40-50 minutes of your time. </strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Experiment Outline</b></h2>
    <p> Before you start searching, we will ask a few questions about you.</p>

    <p>We will then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the search interface by undertaking a <b>practice
        task.</b></p>

    <p>You'll then move onto the <b>four main search tasks</b>.

        Before each task, you will complete a
        <b>pre-task questionnaire</b>
        about your knowledge of the search topic.

        After you complete the task, you will complete a
        <b>post-task questionnaire</b> about the search interface.</p>
